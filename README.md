# Indian_House_Prediction


# Project Overview

* Created a project to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India using different regression models
* Collected and preprocessed a dataset of house attributes and prices from various sources
* Explored and visualized the dataset to understand the relationships between features and target variable

# Regression Models Used

* Linear Regression (LR)
* Decision Tree Regression (DTR)
* Random Forest Regression (RFR)

# Model Comparison and Evaluation

* Trained and evaluated each model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared (R2)
* Compared the performance of each model to determine the best-performing model
* Analyzed the feature importance and partial dependence plots to understand the relationships between features and target variable.

# Conclusion

* The project demonstrated the effectiveness of using regression models to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India
* The comparison and evaluation of different models helped in selecting the best-performing model and hyperparameters
* The insights gained from the project can be used to inform decision-making in the real estate industry, and to develop more accurate and reliable house price prediction models.
